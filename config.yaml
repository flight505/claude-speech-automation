# Speech Automation Configuration
# Enable/disable automatic speech and configure event-specific settings

# Master enable/disable switch for all automatic speech
# Set to true to enable automatic notifications
enabled: true

# Minimum priority score to trigger speech (0-100)
# Higher values = fewer notifications (more selective)
# Lower values = more notifications (more verbose)
min_priority: 30

# Rate limiting (seconds between notifications)
# Prevents notification spam for the same event type
rate_limit_seconds: 60

# Debounce delay (milliseconds)
# Wait time before processing events to batch rapid operations
debounce_ms: 500

# Event-specific configuration
events:
  # Long-running operations (30+ seconds)
  long_running:

  # Test results (pytest, jest, etc.)

# Quiet hours configuration
# Reduce or disable notifications during specified hours
quiet_hours:
  enabled: false
  start_hour: 22  # 10 PM
  end_hour: 7     # 7 AM
  behavior: "reduce"  # Options: "disable" or "reduce"
  priority_multiplier: 0.3  # During quiet hours, multiply priority by this value

# Usage Notes:
# - Use /speech-config to modify settings interactively
# - Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)
# - Nested keys can be set with dot notation: /speech-config set events.errors.enabled false
# - Priority scores: 0-20 (low), 21-50 (medium), 51-80 (high), 81-100 (critical)
